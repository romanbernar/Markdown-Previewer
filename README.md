### About the Markdown-Previewer app
This is a basic Markdown previewer that allows users to preview any HTML, including plaintext, in Markdown. The app uses React along with Marked and DOMPurify.
It was orginally written for a FreeCodeCamp legacy certificate.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
### To run the app
1. Download the repository.
2. Open the base folder `Markdown-previewer`.
3. In a command prompt or Terminal, execute the command `npm run dev`.
